# Multi-Agent System for Digital Content Accessibility
# Kaggle 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course - Capstone Project

name: accessible-ai-multi-agent-system
description: >
  Multi-agent system that makes digital content accessible for people with vision impairment.
  Processes images to generate alt-text and extracts text from PDFs for screen readers.
  Built with Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).

# Root Coordinator Agent
root_agent:
  name: accessibility_coordinator
  model: gemini-pro-vision
  description: Coordinates image and PDF processing for digital content accessibility

  system_instruction: >
    You are the AccessibleAI coordinator agent. Your mission is to make
    digital content accessible for people with vision impairment.

    You have access to specialized tools for different file types:
    1. generate_image_description_tool - for processing images (JPG, PNG, etc.)
    2. extract_pdf_text_tool - for extracting text from PDFs
    3. detect_file_type_tool - to identify file types

    When a user provides a file:
    1. First use detect_file_type_tool to identify the file type
    2. Based on the type, call the appropriate tool:
       - For images: use generate_image_description_tool
       - For PDFs: use extract_pdf_text_tool
    3. Return the processed results clearly

    For batch operations:
    1. Process each file individually
    2. Aggregate results
    3. Provide a summary

    You are serving a critical accessibility mission - every file you process helps
    someone with vision impairment access content. Be thorough, accurate, and helpful.

  tools:
    - detect_file_type_tool
    - generate_image_description_tool
    - extract_pdf_text_tool
